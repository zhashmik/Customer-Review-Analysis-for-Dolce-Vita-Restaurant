rbrech,Silver Spring,3,"Good, not great.","This is a fine Italian restaurant. Nothing outstanding (including the bread that other reviews boast about), and nothing terrible. Dishes are generously proportioned. I enjoyed the veal picatta and my dining partner had a nice bowl of linguine and clams. Service was good. Tables are not so close together that diners can converse with a normal tone of voice.",3/14/2020,3,3,3,3
Diane O,Unknown,1,Valentine's Dinner was AWFUL,"Our Valentine's dinner last night was a complete disappointment.The spinach salad was bland and blah.The brie cheese was so ""funky"" that it was barely edible. The steaks were small and dry -- mine had to be sent back because it was overcooked to the point of being shoe leather. The ""sauce"" was a mystery smear that didn't help with the dryness. The small lobster cake was tasty, I'll give them that. However, the trio of mousse dessert was a joke. Literally three tiny bites of mediocre mousse in what appeared to be a store-bought philo crust.

My husband announced he was still hungry AFTER the full meal (and while signing the check for ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS) and then proceeded to finish off the bread in the basket, which he never does. 

Nothing Italian, nothing substantial, nothing special. I looked around and actually felt really badly for the young couples that I saw sitting there -- taking their girlfriends out for what was a VERY expensive dinner for what was served. They probably had to save up for this special occasion -- and for that to be their meal was just sad. They would have been better off at Ozzie's where they could get a satisfying and tasty meal for half the price. 
 
I'm sure they had great profit margins last night but sadly they phoned it in and we will not be returning.",2/14/2020,1,1,4,1
L4Y,Unknown,3,New years eve pre-fixed dinner,"Let me start by saying we usually love this place.  We also appreciate how hectic a holiday night can be.  The place was less than busy early in the evening (3 tables with patrons).  Handling a prefixed dinner does not seem to be their Forte.  $85/person.  OK... But the food just wasn't worth it. Tasted alright, but serving sizes were small (even the salad wasn't their usual size). A 3 piece bitesize dessert was hardly worth it.  We expect to pay more on a holiday and would generously tip for those giving up their holiday to serve us... But this experience just wasn't with the money.",1/9/2020,4,4,4,4
Happy201501,Bradenton,5,A Classic Local Italian Restaurant Maintains its Standards and Value,We returned to Dolce Vita after a lapse of 5 years during which we had moved to Florida. A lunch at Dolce Vita reminded us of why we loved it. Lunch pastas for $11.99 including a salad and soda are ab great value. All four of  us ordered the cannelloni in a rose colored sauce that was absorbed by fresh bread. The salads were fresh and perfectly paired with salad dressing (balsamic vinegrette and others). I loved the cannoli for dessert accompanied by freshly brewed expresso drinks. A great lunch at a value orice.,1/6/2020,4,4,4,4
jchizzon,Clinton,4,On a recent trip to Northern,"On a recent trip to Northern Virginia, I ate at Dolce Vita for a second time.  Both times this restaurant did not disappoint.  It is high end Italian done well. During this visit, I had a seafood soup that was incredible.",1/3/2020,4,4,4,4
HalibutVA,Springfield,5,Great Local Italian!,"This is a nice cozy space with cute décor, phenomenal service and authentic Italian food.

Steffenserves,Unknown,5,Dinner with Family,We had a group of 8 for dinner before Christmas. Everyone raved about it. The service and drinks were top-notched. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.,12/26/2019,4,4,4,4
Tom Porter,Washington DC,3,"Excellent ambiance, mixed food results","Family dinner here, including three kids who eat out a lot at a wide range of restaurants. Attentive service and fun holiday decor. Five stars to the hostess who squeezed us in last minute on a busy Saturday night. The sausage and pepperoni pizza was very good, but the cheese pizza was just ok. My daughter had the fettuccine alfredo, she wasn't a fan. It was lacking in flavor. Another daughter and I had the fettuccine carbonara, which had a bit more flavor to it, but mainly because of the bacon. It was very good only after heavy parmesan, salt and pepper, but my kid ate it plain and she said it was just ok. The alfredo sauce needs some rework. To be fair, on a prior visit, my wife and I had a very good meal.",12/14/2019,4,4,4,4
cfuller603,Washington DC,3,Not like I remembered it,"I used to live in Fairfax and loved this place which was always hard to get into on a weekend. So I went with my daughter for lunch during the week with high expectations--which were not met. I had just come back from Florence, Italy, so maybe my sights were too high.  The Bruschetta was not typical Italian, though it was good for me.  But my daughter didn't like the fact that the bread was soft and the mild cheese was melted on top (not Buffalo as in Italy).  The Garlic Shrimp Linguini was good but nothing special. The Shrimp Marinara was just so so.  Service was a bit lackadaisical.  

Doubt I'll go back.",12/3/2019,3,3,3,3
cbfield,Birmingham,5,Almost perfect,"Very good service. Great food: fettuccini alfredo with a wonderful sauce, chicken piccata, and veal saltamboca. Chocolate bread pudding and cremé bruleé for dessert. Only drawbacks: it was very loud - too loud for much conversation - and cold where we were seated near the door.",10/20/2019,5,5,5,5
belroseplace,San Diego,5,Still my fav Italian near DC,"I used to live in Falls Church but have been away for 6 years.  While there, Dolce Vita was absolutely my favorite Italian restaurant.  Don't know if they still do it, but on Friday nights they had a man who played guitar and sang, I loved that.  Back for a visit and went for lunch with a 92 year old Sicilian.  I knew the carbonara was not on the lunch menu, but asked if it was possible to get it.  They said absolutely and made it special for me.  My friend had the stuffed shells and commented that their red sauce was excellent and the dish made him feel like home.  I love the atmosphere, the service is impeccable, the food is perfect and it's just a lovely experience.  Highly recommended!",10/12/2019,5,5,5,5
Judithpal,Gaithersburg,5,We had a love lunch for our first time visit,"We planned a stay overnight in Fairfax, VA as we were invited to one of my client's for dinner and the next day we would be going to Remington to visit with my son's family.

This is a small but very nice restaurant. They have a fairly nice wine list and to our surprise a very inexpensive menu for lunch.  We didn't want too much because the dinner we were attending later would be large.

My husband ordered the Sausage & Pepper sub sandwich and he said this was really good. He ordered a side salad to go with this meal and I had one, too. The salad was very fresh and was a nice accompaniment to my meatball and Parmigiana sandwich. I've had meatball Parmigiana sandwiches before, but not in a LONG time. The meatballs were plump, juicy and very well seasoned. This was a new experience for me. Many times the meatballs are tiny and hard. I was really surprised. They have a very nice selection of Italian wines and the Chianti we selected was perfect for our lunch.  We finished with two double espressos.

Service was good with a bit of a wait. The restaurant was busy when we arrived and stayed busy the entire time we were there.  They have a nice wine bar and also offer a wine club.  I wish they were closer to my home because this would mean we would be a regular.

I can't answer for everything on the menu but if the meal we had for lunch is any indication I would say you can depend on getting authentic Italian food.",10/8/2019,5,5,4,5
dariuszk888,Fairfax,5,Good Place for Lunch,"Good place for Italian food in Fairfax, VA. Parking can be a problem but most of the time it is sufficient to accommodate during lunch time. Food is very good and authentic.

Aquatic P,Unknown,3,Meh,For a restaurant that has such great reviews I was disappointed.  Been to other Italian restaurants in the area that are much better.,7/13/2019,4,4,4,4
IrishRed2,Unknown,1,"Too many other, better restaurants. Skip this one.","This restaurant was a large disappointment.  I took my family out after graduation. We were crammed in a center aisle, even though there were better choices for a group of 9 to sit (open table reservations well in advance) and our server, who was a long-time employee, was abysmal. We spent $600 before tip and he never - not one time ever - asked if our food was good, if we wanted anything else, etc.  Drinks went unreplenished and condiments were missing. Ten minutes went by before I could find a server to get butter, which did not come with the potatoes. Water was never refilled.  The restaurant is just not that large that he could avoid us, but he studiously walked around us every time. We wanted more drinks! We wanted to spend more, but we could not.  

The noise level was atrocious. SO SO loud. We could barely hear our immediate neighbor. All this might have been tolerable if the food was good, but it was, at best, fair. No big complaints, but it was bland and uninteresting.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. They should be good to whomever they serve, but when you have a large party you have crowded in between tables, and you know that they are going to spend a lot of money, it is surprising that you're not interested in making them happy.",6/7/2019,1,3,1,3

DianeRoanoke,Unknown,4,Great selection of Italian entrees,"This was my 4th visit to Dolce Vita, and there will be more on future trips to the area.  I have tried pasta, seafood, salads, and all were excellent.  Be prepared for large servings. The waitstaff is most accommodating.",3/30/2019,4,4,4,4
strattonz,Stratford,5,wonderful celebration,"we had 15 family/friends coming from out of state to celebrate my son's graduation.  from the first phone conversation i knew i had picked the right place.  meghan was super helpful with the arrangements.  the gentleman that helped me with the day of final details was awesome.  we wanted a private place to be able to gather and visit.  the cantina gave us that space and privacy.  the food was delicious, the servings were perfect and the service could not have been better.  i recommend Dolce Vita for a private event, and can't say enough about their professional and friendly staff.

oldkitchentable,Unknown,4,Best Lunch in Town!,"We’re locals and have visited DV for many meals over the years. The food is reliably good, likely the best Italian in the Fairfax area. 
We’ve hosted an event in the Cantina, enjoyed apps and dinner in the wine bar and dinner in the main restaurant.

hankorej,Ocean Isle Beach,4,"Very Popular, Very Busy","Very popular place with minimal parking so valet parking is almost a must. The best thing about La Dolce Vita is that the food is very good with generous potions. After that a few flaws.Adequate wait staff but minimal interest in the customer. Wine list ok but heavy on little known wines. The restaurant itself is nice in a sort of neighborhood tavern style but it is sorely in need of a complete makeover.
I'll come back for the food!",1/20/2019,4,4,3,4
BirTurk,Tysons Corner,4,Close to authentic!,"Great wood fired pizza unburned! Strongly recommend octopus. Very delicate authentic Italian dishes. Try grilled calamar, not fried. Two things we don't like- they still pick your plate up as soon as you finish your meal. Very un-European! Second and the most important, the parking problem. I don't like valet parking and to park myself and keep the key. That's not the case in Dolce Vita. That's why try to go there after 9 pm once the crowd is gone and you can park without abandoning your key to the attendants.",1/3/2019,4,4,4,4

megah118,West Babylon,3,Decent Local Restaurant,We ate in the wine bar section of the restaurant.  The wines we had were delicious and they had a nice selection.  Crisp tasty bread was served.

Oldpeter69,Saint Louis,4,Good Italian place,"This is a pretty busy place with quite tight seating options. If you are going on the weekend you better have a reservation.
The food was really great and the price/value was good.
The pizza tasted great, penne a la vodka is always awesome, maybe the lasagna was not my favorite but that’s all about preference",11/10/2018,4,4,4,4
sailingboat,Fairfax,5,WIne Bar is Great!,"Our friends made a reservation for four and that was confirmed, but we later learned that the wine bar takes reservations only for parties of six or more. But when we showed up, the staff worked to make this error right. They found us seats at the bar and reassured us that this first come first served spot would make an exception for us. We just started to enjoy our drinks when a table opened and before we could even start to consider the many tempting plates, a plate of bacon-wrapped shrimp appeared ""on the house,"" the restaurant's way of saying ""sorry for the inconvenience."" So what a great start to what might have been a disappointing experience! Even without the lovely and gracious hospitality, this place would still get rave reviews from me. Staff as noted are cheerful, helpful, and on hand when you need them. The small plates are so good and presented with a lot of style. Note to self. In future, pace yourself! No need to order everything at one time. The truffle dusted shoestring fries are lovely to share. Loved the trio of artichokes on stem--like veggie lollipops, and the creamy gnocchi and shrimp--oh boy! Some small plates are just ok. The meatballs and shortribs are a bit lacky in flavor and the calamari with beans, which should have been hearty, was just bland. But overall, the food is really good. An added bonus, you can order anything from the full restaurant menu if you want to, but it would be a shame to miss out on these lovely small plates. It's a really fun way to spend time with good friends over shared dishes. Great decor, great ambience, great food, great staff! We liked this very much and will come again.",10/29/2018,5,5,5,5

Iris H,Fairfax,5,Wine Bar is the Hidden Gem,"We have been coming here for several years and never really noticed the Wine Bar next door.  This is truly my favorite spot now - seating is not crowded, subdued lighting & cozy.    And they have outdoor seating  What's great is you can order from their small plates menu - which is extensive, OR the main restaurant's menu.  I had the grilled Scallop Trio - just WOW!!  The truffle & parmesan fries are yummy and enough to share.  My husband is a pizza fan - he tried the flat bread pizza and ended up ordering another.  The main Restaurant is great, albeit a little crowded for seating, and the booth seats are too shallow for me. Try any of the wood fired pizzas - but the grilled calamari is terrific!",10/13/2018,5,5,5,5
Ronald H,Oak Grove,5,Solo Italian,"Prima Italiano!  Might not have even noticed this little gem if it weren’t right next door to my hotel. It is tucked into a small-ish strip between a tire store and Exxon station. Reservations aren’t required but I’d advise it just due to limited capacity. The locals obviously know this secret as I was seated at the bar next to the hostess and nearly all who came in had reservations. I did not. But as luck would have it, I was seated immediately nonetheless. The pizza oven by the front door has more character than most (see pic below). 

The bread and oil were light and fresh. A hint of citrus in the oil was a nice change to most of the olive oils in other restaurants. 

I selected the seafood and fettucini dish known as Fettuccine Ai Frutti Di Mare with freshly made fettucini, scallops, jumbo shrimp, lump crab and portabello mushrooms all in a white wine cream sauce. IT WAS DELIGHTFUL!!  And in just the right serving size to allow me to indulge in one of my all time favs - tiramisu. 

Don’t blink or you’ll miss it but even if you do, make a Uturn. You’ll be happy you did. 

There’s also an adjacent wine bar which was rented out for a party since it is normally closed on Sundays according to the lovely hostess Caroline.",9/29/2018,4,4,4,4
psujmu,Springfield,5,Great Italian,"Took the wife and son for her Birthday and took a chance and short drive to Dolce Vita...It as a first visit and the decor was ok, became more comfortable as the night went on as the service and food were excellent!

EMG10605,Fairfax,3,After many years we won’t be going back,This was always a favorite of ours. However on our last 2 visits the food was ok but the service not very good. My biggest pet peeve is having your entree arrive when your first course isn’t even half finished. This time we even waited to order our main course so we could finish our salads but they still were served before we finished.   We were really disappointed.,7/31/2018,4,4,4,4
Mary P,Unknown,5,Italian to satisfy New Jerseians,"My husband is from New Jersey, and he says this place tastes like any of the ""legit"" Italian places back home. I, a mere Virginian, just like the food-consistently delicious Italian comfort food and seafood. Never had the pizza but it looks amazing, and the wood fired oven is shaped like a face.

inarlington,Unknown,3,"Food is very good, but the service for our planned, special event was NOT","Let me start by saying this review is specifically about hosting a special event in the Cantina, which is Dolce Vita's private party room, in a building immediately next to the restaurant. (If it were for the food alone, I would give 4 or maybe 5 stars, so regular diners should go and enjoy. The food is very good.) 
I want people considering having their event in the Cantina to be aware of our experience. While the food was very good, the service and attention to our private event was lacking. The executive chef, who had been my contact all along, all but grunted at us upon arrival - seriously, shockingly rude - and the waiter assigned to us was a nice guy and capable, but completely alone; no additional help was given to him for every bit of taking orders, serving drinks and multiple courses, and clearing the table between (which he could not realistically manage)  courses. Our guests were gracious and kind, but there were lots of plates left on the table and people waited a long time for drinks and refills, etc.  This was a private dinner for 22 people.  It was not manageable for one waiter, no matter how good they were.  Additionally, the private bathroom in the Cantina could definitely have been cleaner, and the light fixture was busted so they had a standing lamp in there. It wasn't quite the image I'd imagined. Overall, they could make this room amazing, but it comes across as if they didn't care, which was painful since this was a special night for my family.  
I emailed the restaurant to voice my concerns, but have not heard back. 
Positives: The food and wine were great, the waiter was nice and as capable as one person could be with such a crowd. Also, you can use their bluetooth to play your own music, and they have a screen for a slideshow or whatever you'd want for your group. 

This space has so much promise, but it is a bit run down. They definitely need to give it more attention - it's a unique space that few restaurants have.",7/4/2018,4,4,2,4

I told the server I get what I ask for at Artie’s all the time, as well as can do it at home no problem.  To their credit, I think they spiraled a whole lime and I got the benefit of an inches long lime rind in my martini which was good. But really to tell a customer they should order something else instead of what they asked for when it is not something off the chart and they have a full bar?  I did leave a very good tip based on my bill total as I was appreciative.  But if anyone knows of an excellent Italian restaurant in this area I would love to learn of it.",5/26/2018,4,4,4,4

All 6 members had different items off of the menu, Steak, Pastas, Chicken, Seafood and most everyone stopped eating during their meal and did not like it enough to continue. 

The beer and wine selection is good, but that""s about all this place has going for it. 

As someone who has been to Italy in the last month, this is certainly not authentic Italian food. There was no flavor to the sauces, nor was the pasta fresh tasting. I would not recommend Dolce Vita, unfortunately.",5/16/2018,1,1,3,1

Of course we checked the reviews and had high expectations. We were not disappointed. We sat at the bar and the bartenders not only greeted us, but introduced themselves and remembered our names all night. This place was packed with regulars. Happy hour prices on wine were exceptional, along with the appetizers. We sat next to a regular of 20 years and she guided us through a wonderful array of foods: Dolce Gamberi (sauted shrimp in a pernod cream sauce) was out of this world; and 'make your own' flatbread allowed us to pair with the wine, a hearty super Tuscan. We topped off the first night with an incredible lava cake. I don't have enough adjectives to describe the meal and the staff.  We returned (read: 'ran back') the next night and ate at a cozy table on the restaurant side of the bar. Again, the traditional Italian dishes of Bolognese and Sausage & peppers were outstanding. Dolce Vita had us wishing we lived locally. If arriving after, 6:30 p.m. you will want to make reservations.",4/11/2018,4,4,4,4
Matthew C,Fairfax,3,Tried to see what was better than before. Didn't happen.,"It had been years since we last went here. Many years ago I went every year with friends and our daughters before Father/Daughter dances and the kids always had a great time and they were great hosts. 

When it came to going as a couple and expecting fine dining, we were always left expecting more. When the wine bar opened up next door we tied that too. pizza in waffle cones isn't a thing. Unless your five.

So we stopped going. Then we started to see and hear reviews that said there was a new owner and new perspective and that they even were selected in local magazines as being a top destination. Still, we couldn't bring ourselves to brave the afternoon or evening horrible traffic for a chance that it was more than it was before.

Last week my wife had an appointment on that side of town one afternoon so we decided to meet there for happy hour. That won't happen again. 

Granted we didn't go into the restaurant but rather stayed at the bar.

Mixed drinks were very good but some common liguor selections are not to be found. Wine selection is average at best. Food was ok but nothing really exciting. Staff argued with each other constantly and the environment was odd as the bar was open but they also had a local business group holding a meeting there complete with demo tables of products. 

Needlessly, how they were voted Best Happy Hour in Northern Virginia is a complete mystery. Stay in the car for 10 more minutes and drive to Fairfax Corner.",3/27/2018,3,3,3,3
travelingbeachbum00,Rehoboth Beach,4,Authentic Italian,We had a great meal with homemade pasta.  Red cream sauce was very tasty.  Started with the house salad and it was very fresh with a great vinaigrette dressing.  Service was very friendly and attentive.,3/13/2018,4,4,4,4
Paulie_1955,Fairfax,5,"Authentic, creative Italian food","Some friends of ours recommended this place after they had eaten there, so we tried it. We were not disappointed.

dandeg,Fairfax,3,Great atmosphere for a small dinner,"We have been to Dolce Vita for many years - used to love the live italian music and singing, I have not seen that recently.  The make up of the meals have changed recently, but I feel you can still find a good italian seafood dinner - I tend to stay away from the pastas because I want to go for something I don't make at home.",2/17/2018,3,3,4,3
fiamma11,Tysons Corner,2,Not as Good As I Had Hoped.,"My husband ordered spaghetti marinara but it was orange in color and looked like Chef Boyardee. I ordered the grilled calamari ensalata. The salad was good but the calamari tasted fishy and I could not enjoy it. I ate the salad underneath and surrounding it and left the calamari sadly behind. On a positive note, the wine was very good and was priced very well, so I might return for the wine and try a different entree. Service was very good and the decor interesting with murals of Italian greats.",2/12/2018,3,2,4,2
Lois K,Fairfax,4,Big Birthday Party,"Large group party, hors d'oerves good, margarete pizza ok.  Wife has Salmon (very good) with clams & mussels.  I had Capellinni Bolognese (good),  Tiramisou and cannoli desserts were tasty.  Good selection of fairly priced beers and wines.  Service solid in the party environment.",2/3/2018,4,4,3,4
anakarerina,Reston,3,Service very good.,"Not sure if they switched managers/ owners or chef. This time around I was a bit disappointed. My carbonara did not taste like fresh pasta, neither too Italian.
It was more toppings than sauce. Everything was rough chop, and it did not leave anything to shine in the dish.

The same thing happened with a risotto, there was so much going on in the dish that again you were not entirely sure what you were eating.

Basically, my recommendation is you are looking for simple Italian food, this will not be the place.Maybe it used to, or maybe it was just this time around.

The restaurant is still pricey, but the portions are huge.

The best thing that we order was the zucchini rollatini, that was simple and delicious and pretty unique.",1/29/2018,3,3,5,3
Sharon M,Roanoke,4,Great authentic Italian Restaurant,Authentic Italian dishes.   The food and atmosphere here is wonderful.  I am sure the noodles are homemade.  The portions are large and filling.   The booths are intimate.  The appetizers are the best around and the lava cake for dessert is fabulous.   The only complaint is the service is slow but believe this is more to give patrons privacy,1/28/2018,4,4,4,4
Pete078,Unknown,3,Maybe we came too early,Vitello Saltimbocca tasted like was left over from lunch and warmed up.  The pizza was way too gooey.  The service was very good.,1/22/2018,4,4,4,4
Tom S,Nashville,5,"Authentic, excellent Italian","We visited Dolce Vita for the first time and found our new favorite Italian restaurant.  All dishes are authentic Italian and delicious.  The restaurant is casual, you can come in your jeans or come dressed up. There are larger booths that can fit a family or group of 6-8 and smaller tables suitable for 2 or 4. Ask for a table toward the back of the restaurant for quiet conversation.  The front has a bit more energy - good for a family celebration.  Our server was Italian as well and conveyed the Italian spirit of 'food is family, food is celebration'.  We had a great evening, came away thoroughly impressed, and hope to return for dinner soon!",1/10/2018,5,5,5,5
Deborah M,Port Saint Joe,5,Great Food and Service,"Went here for lunch on a very cold day & was immediately warmed up by a welcoming staff member & the heat coming off the brick oven. Sat where I wanted, which is a plus for me. Prices were extremely reasonable & included a soda, menu items were varied & all sounded yummy. I chose a chicken parm sandwich with a side Caesar salad 🥗. Came with shaved Parmesan cheese on it along with homemade croutons. The sandwich was huge! Tasted delicious and I was also served some rustic bread with butter & Parmesan along with oil on the side. Couldn’t finish my sandwich so I took it home to an appreciative husband. Will go again before this trip is over!",1/7/2018,4,4,4,4

Bob B,Oakton,4,pranzo con mio amico,I used to come here a lot but haven't been here recently.  This is one of the few pizza places that make pizza in a wood fired oven.  It really does taste different.  It was the first business day after the new year.  Not busy.  Good service. good food.  The server (Angel) was very attentive and checked back with us often.

Michelle S,Alexandria,4,House-made pasta - YUM!,"I was looking for an independent restaurant away from any mall areas for an early dinner during the last shopping days of Christmas.  Found this place online - what a hidden treasure!!  We arrived just after 5pm and had the place to ourselves.  For 15 minutes.  The reason it's so popular became apparent when the grilled calamari was brought out.  Perfection!!  The pasta is house-made.  The panna cotta was light and airy and a perfect way to close out dinner.  A nice wine list and great service round out this review.  I will definitely make the effort to return.  Great meal, great service - just perfect!",12/26/2017,4,4,4,4

beachgirlxxoo,Fairfax,5,YUM all the way around!,"Great Saturday evening with friends! Delightful booth and perfect food from start to finish. We shared a white pizza and Caesar salads as appetizers.  Crunchy Italian bread with olive oil and shredded Parmesan. Four entrees, pasta a la Vodka, veal saltimboca, Italian shepherds pie (chef kind enough to switch out polenta for mashed potatoes) and one other (sorry not sure what my friend ordered). All entrees superb, piping hot and plentiful. Three different wine selections by the glass, excellent!  Not one complaint. Love this place!  We enjoy every Christmas eve dinner here as well. It’s also very nice to meet friends in their wine bar and enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail.  Highly recommend.",12/10/2017,4,4,4,4
Jack S,Fairfax,2,"Disappointing food, ambiance","Three people eating. Asked for a booth and got some strange arrangement. They kind of separated a table and divided one booth to make two. It was uncomfortable and would have been really uncomfortable had they seated anyone else with us. And quite frankly the food was on a par with Olive Garden, but priced about 30-40% higher. Fettuccini Carbonara was very average. No bacon, used pancetta only. We also shared the bacon wrapped shrimp and were seriously disappointed. This is a dish that needs care to prepare. Shrimp and bacon are hard to cook together and have both come out tasty.In our case the shrimp was slightly overcooked (tough). Plus they kind of drizzled the lobster sauce on the plate. If you are going to serve tough shrimp you better give plenty of sauce to help out, which they didn't. We also had the Sicilian salad, certainly nothing great. We  had a stuffed eggplant dish which was served with mushy, clumped angel hair. At least the sauce was good. The service was fairly good, and the pizza oven ""head"" is cute. But the wine is also over priced. Anyway, we won't be rushing back.",11/16/2017,2,2,3,2
Carl L,Princeville,4,Big Group Dinner,"My organization had a dinner at Dolce Vita in their banquet building, The banquet building is a separate building from main restaurant.  The service and the meals were very good.  Everyone in my organization enjoyed the dinner.",11/4/2017,3,4,5,4
LDJKY,Unknown,5,Loved it,My sister was visiting last night and we went to DV for the first time. It was packed and we didn't have a reservation but they seated us in the wine bar where we were still able to order off of the main menu.  I can't say enough good things.  I loved the farm to table touches with fresh herbs growing in the window and their relationships with local farms.  All  of the food was delicious.  Desserts are made in-house.  Our server was charming and warm.  The atmosphere was friendly and pleasant.  The prices weren't bad for the quality and quantity of food.  I'll definitely go back.  Might be my new favorite Fairfax restaurant.,11/4/2017,4,5,5,5
New_Month_New_Trip,Unknown,5,Happy Hour and Great Italian Food... a perfect combo,"Stopped here on a Monday night for the first time based on reviews on Trip Advisor and availability of reservations via Open Table.  Reservations were for 5:00 pm in the restaurant and arrived earlier than expected at 4:40 pm.  For those that are not aware, these actually have two separate entrances …. the restaurant, and the adjacent Wine Bar, with a shared kitchen. Restaurant does not unlock its doors for dinner until 5 pm therefore we decided to go next door to the Wine Bar and had a GREAT time.  Typical bar… high top tables, some booths, stand-alone tables, and of course, the bar.  Was pleased to find out we were right on time for Happy Hour in the Wine Bar which runs Monday thru Saturday from 4 - 7 pm,.  I can understand why it got the rating ""Best Happy Hour in Northern VA"".  We were set on a bottle of the chianti but at the suggestion of our waitress, Fran, we opted for a bottle of the Toscana Rosso which was a bit ""heartier"" than the chianti.  At $27 for the bottle, how can you go wrong? We were not disappointed. GREAT suggestion.  Although most of the items on the bar menu are smaller plates, similar to a tapas, we were able to order from the restaurant menu from next door and have it served in the Wine Bar.  Smart move on the part of the owners!  We started by sharing a Caesar Salad ($6.99). Lettuce was fresh, crispy and cold but not like it had been ""pre-made"" and kept in a refrigerator in the kitchen.  Fresh shaved slices of parmesan cheese made it special.  Complimentary fresh Italian bread was served with olive oil to which we added some fresh grated parmesan cheese.  We chose to share an entree of Penne Arrabbiata ($13.99) to which we added a side of shrimp ($6.99).  Penne pasta was served with black olives, hot cherry peppers, capers, and tomatoes per the menu along with a generous portion of large, fresh, perfectly cooked shelled shrimp.  Again… perfection!  The small room began to fill up as the evening went on and I could see the noise level being a bit loud if filled but, hey, it's a bar!  If you want quiet, I'd suggest you stick with the restaurant next door.  Either way…. you'll have a great meal, with excellent service.  Thx again to Fran for making it special.  We'll definitely be back.  At $70+ for a shared appetizer, entrée, and bottle of red wine this place is definitely a price performer in Northern VA.",10/23/2017,5,5,5,5
karenlpn,Bell,5,Early supper,On the recommendation of Best Western desk employees we went to Dolce Vita for supper after a long day in DC....; it was a small restaurant that I would not have picked had it not been praised so highly by the desk clerk and trip advisor; I ordered eggplant parmigiana; it was wonderful!! Best I have ever eaten and served on a bed of angel hair pasta and sauce; huge portions too; hubby had pasta and meatballs that he throughly enjoyed as well; service was fast and friendly but it was before 5pm when we were there; would highly recommend!!,10/22/2017,4,4,4,4

mikelynxx,Manassas,4,Great little wine bar,"We have eaten at Dolce Vita previously but decided to try the wine bar the other night.  Quiet, quaint with wonderful aromas from the kitchen.

Very good selection of wines but would like more of a selection of wines by the glass.",10/2/2017,4,4,3,4
Margaret T,Unknown,5,Wine Bar wedding reception,"We have enjoyed Dolce Vita for decades for lunches and dinners, but the staff went all out for our son's wedding reception last weekend! From the beginning, when we were just in the planning stages through the actual event- we were so pleased with their flexibility, creative problem solving, and overall warmth with us and our guests. They discretely added more seating when unplanned guests arrived, allowed off-the-menu ordering for those requesting it, and served delicious starters, entrees and desserts. It was an exceptional evening for our family and friends. Great place with very reasonable pricing - a memorable evening!",10/1/2017,4,4,4,4

Muffarah M,Seaford,5,Charming,"Pretty authentic Italian place, not very big but the first thing you see as you enter is a huge wood fired pizza oven just behind the hostess who takes you to your seat. The tables are arranged for 2, or 4 and there are booths lining the side for 4 or 6, some are curved. The service is great, they keep a close watch on you and do not forget you, food is brought at the right intervals, the napkins are cloth although the tables are bare. It is a nice place with a good vibe, lots of people relaxing and eating and enjoying each other's company.

Any of the pasta dishes will delight you! Their lasagne,fettuccine Alfredo and home made meat or cheese ravioli are outstanding. I love their broiled calamari for appetizer and house salad with vinaigrette. Meals are accompanied by a great crusty Italian bread and their choice of house wines are a great value. They do offer a nice selection of wines. Don't leave without trying their tiramisu or fresh filled cannolis and a cup of cappuccino ! Great quality,value and consistently efficient service.",6/6/2017,5,5,5,5
Jane G,Washington DC,5,A Sure Bet!,"Even though we live about five miles from this restaurant and have passed it hundreds of times, its site off Lee Highway and unimpressive look did nothing to encourage me to try it. 

So, it was more than a pleasant surprise when we stopped in about six months ago, needing a quick dinner, and discovered a place that obviously has many loyal customers as well as excellent food and service.

Our only disappointment was that we were in a rush and couldn't sit and savor the meal. So, we went back yesterday with the intent of having a leisurely dinner and really enjoyed ourselves.

We started with the gamberi cinque terre, shrimp stuffed with fontina cheese, wrapped in bacon, and topped with lobster sauce--delicious! I had a soft shelled crab over linguini, also out of this world, and two others had fettucini or fettucini carbonara, which they raved about. Dessert was also excellent. 

This is an old-fashioned Italian restaurant with all the traditional favorites in addition to more updated dishes. 

It's a friendly place where families are welcome yet sophisticated enough for singles and couples. 

We talked about going back to try some of the other dishes. They all sounded delicious . . . and I'm sure that they are!

Try it . . . you'll like it!",6/4/2017,4,5,5,5

Got there and the hostess was kind of staring at us like we had committed a crime. She then, with an empty restaurant, manage to find the smallest table available. 

I thought, OK, place will get packed soon. We ordered calamari....wow. It was tasteless and odd. I have never seen grilled calamari and not breaded and fried. Then we ordered Veal Marsala. Another disappointment ....it was like noodles and veal in a very liquid tasteless marsala sauce. We finish dinner and there were still 60% of the restaurant empty. Waiter was attentive and awesome. He is the only thing this place has going for them.  Pretty sad experience.",5/19/2017,4,4,4,4

LoveToTravel30226,Alexandria,5,Wonderful food,"This was our first visit to Dolce Vita, and we look forward to returning. Our waiter was from Venice and was very friendly and helpful. He recommended an excellent Chianti wine, and brought fresh bread and olive oil. We all appreciated that he then stepped away to give us plenty of time to talk and decide what we wanted to eat. We all had homemade pasta, and it was excellent - three of us had papparadelle (two with ragu sauce, one with Bolognese sauce), and one had ravioli with pesto sauce. Everything was tasty, flavorful and hot from the kitchen. We didn't have room for dessert, but we'll be back. It was quite crowded by the time we left, and it gets loud with everyone talking, but it added to the atmosphere. The parking lot is quite small, but they have a free valet service, which we used. There is also a wine bar next door, so if you arrive early for your reservation, you can pop in and have a pre-dinner glass of wine.",5/16/2017,4,5,4,5

The food was fantastic and reasonably priced for a sit down Italian restaurant. Service was decent. The restaurant was extremely busy on a Friday evening.

The mozzarella was old, rubbery and tasteless.  The ""vine ripe tomatoes"" were not.  Both our pasta dishes were luke-warm and also tasteless.  Maybe the cook passed various Italian spices over the pots where the sauces were cooking; unfortunately, none fell in.  On the plus side, the service was quick and efficient and atmosphere was nice. The restaurant was crowded.  Based on our meal, I can't imagine why.  We won't be adding to the crowds there again.  There are numerous good and very good Italian restaurants in the northern Virginia area, I'd recommend one of those before going to Dolce Vita.",2/17/2017,2,2,4,2

Tania M,Fairfax,3,Home made pasta needs to be reviewed,The pasta they make in house is way too thick for their clams dish Theyneed to turn it down a notch - also the pasta is way over cooked.  This has not been the same since it was recently taken over.   We had NO complaints in the past.  If they can adjust the pasta thickness and cook it correctly they are in a win win situation,2/15/2017,3,3,4,3
Jack S,Fairfax,4,"Very good food, decent price","Not the best location since it's near the car wash and some semi-industrial operations. But for the most part you can park nearby so it doesn't make much difference. But the menu is good if you like traditional Italian. Try the veal and spinach cannelloni, delicious. Plus some good new takes on traditional shrimp entrees. Fair prices for original treatments of traditional Italian fare.",2/12/2017,4,4,4,4

Service is quick, efficient and unobtrusive.  My most recent visit was a business dinner for 6 people, and we had a nice table in an alcove in the back.  Various members of our group ordered the pizza margherita, salmon with seasonal vegetables, penne arrabbiata and lasagna.

Topped off with tiramisu which is prepared in an individual ceramic dish.  We were a bit early so seating was no problem.  Service was attentive but not hovering.

It must have been 2pm when we arrived, not noticing that the unobstussive lettering on the front glass announced that the restaurant closed at 2:30 and reopened at 5pm. There was a table of 3 and a table of 2 being served when we came in and another couple walked in after we had been ""sitted"".
We were disappointed at the limited menu, limited pasta sauce offerings, this been an ""italian"" restaurant. The ""flat"", unexpressive waiter did not add to any possibility of a pleasant lunch, nor his insistence to settle the bill, most likely because was ""after hours"", after 2:30pm, and he wanted to ""leave the place"" or lay down on the corner stool bench and go to deep sleep. We left. Nobody said goodbye or thank you.",9/10/2016,4,4,4,4
KDI2013,Washington DC,3,"Good but not great, inconsistent","As others have said, it is small, a little noisy, but what ""bothered"" me was the busy black line drawings on the walls, very stark, could have used the softening of (fake, even) hanging green plants, a mirror or two....
'Nuf about that - the food.... I enjoyed the bruschetta, but I wish they had toasted the bread slices before they put on the tomatoes and cheese - it was very soggy, and I don't remember soggy bruschetta in Italy.  However, my husband's appetizer was the shrimp wrapped with bacon and a balsamic drizzle - very good!
However, his main dish of Veal Parmigiana was the same old, same old...little tough, overcooked - perhaps they do better on items that are not run of the mill, because my Veal Piccata was really good.
My husband's tiramisu for dessert looked good, but I was stuffed.  I might go back, he says he wouldn't.  But I think some of their dishes can be good, give it a try!

Lesley S,Colorado Springs,5,Try the seafood fettuccine!,"We went out to dinner with a friend that grew up in Fairfax, who raved about this place. It's a small, intimate restaurant and we really, really enjoyed it. They serve a spongy homemade bread at each table with an olive oil-Parmesan dipping combo which is so good that you don't even care that you're going to fill up before your food arrives. 

I had the seafood fettuccine that was the best fettuccine I've ever had! It had huge jumbo shrimp, scallops, and crab meat with just the right amount of cream sauce. Divine. 

My husband had a grilled chicken pizza which was good, but not wow worthy. I'd say stick with the pasta dishes!!",8/30/2016,4,4,4,4

Beekuz,Reston,5,Really Surprisingly Good Italian Food,"We've had to be thrifty lately so when we go out to eat we don't like to be disappointed. Also being from New York, the bar for Italian food is quite high and I've been disappointed with the food in Virginia overall. I ordered the Veal Marsala, which is my benchmark dish for good Italian Cuisine, and it just melted in my mouth. The sauce was great and the veal was tender. My wife and Son also had great dishes, my Son had a Seafood Fettuccine Alfredo dish which I tried and really liked, even though I'm usually not a big fan of cheese sauces. Even the extra virgin olive oil served with the bread was great. The only regret I have is not saving room for dessert. We'll definitely be going back when we have that craving for good Italian food. Really interested in trying their wood fired pizza next. I hope you enjoy and get there early since parking is probably the biggest downside of the location.",8/9/2016,5,5,5,5
capandrews,Fayetteville,4,Authentic Wood Fired Oven,This restaurant has an authentic Tuscan feel. The focaccia bread appetizer reminded me of a pizza shop in Lucca.

Also thoroughly enjoyed the baked breaded shrimp. The Risotto Mushroom was our least favorite but still good.

tigerseye,Washington DC,4,"First visit, won't be the last","I went to Dolce Vita for the first time this weekend with Mrs. Tigerseye and one of the little Tigerseye's. Wonderful, good service, convenient location for us, and a good variety of pasta, seafood, meats, salads, pizza, and appetizers to choose from. Not so pricey as other Italian restaurants in the area. We had a 10 minute wait past our reservation time, and were seated in the main restaurant at prime time on a Saturday night. Very crowded, and the noise level is high inside due to all the tile on the walls--it was quite hard to hear our conversations, but the din dropped off as the evening went on, especially after 8:30 PM. Our waiter was excellent and gave good recommendations to little Tigerseye who couldn't decide what to order--then stuck with a salad and side of pasta carbonara. Mussels and clams we had were delicious and quite large in the appetizer portions, both served in a garlic/wine sauce that was terrific. I had veal tortellini in a fontina sauce and Mrs. Tigerseye had fettucini alfredo, absolutely delectable. All pastas are hand made on site. Only issue was the bus-men were a bit too helpful in removing plates before we finished. But we really enjoyed the visit and will be back again soon to try other entrees. Wood fired pizza oven looked really good, as did the wine bar. The restaurant is in a strip mall, so cars need to be valet parked.",6/22/2016,5,5,4,5
IdahoKid,Boise,4,"Good Food, Big Portions, Service Could Be Better","This was a family visit with 3 adults and 3 teens, all big fans of Italian food.  And, for the most of the food served, we were not disappointed. Servings were quite large and delicious.  Only slightly off note was the calamarie which was grilled, not breaded and fried, and which nobody at the table enjoyed.  Mussels, cannaloni, spaghetti alfredo and spaghetti with sausage were all excellent, even if the servings were overly generous. We were there on a weekday evening, a little on the late side, so the place wasn't crowded, but yet the service was a bit spotty.  While our orders were taken promptly and the food came out as expected, ordering a second glass of wine or getting the water glasses refilled took some waving and pointing across the dining room. Otherwise, a good experience.",6/7/2016,4,5,3,5

cjbenz,Unknown,4,A Taste of Italy,"Dining here was like dining in a small, family restaurant in Italy. Staff was friendly. Service was very good with just the right interval between courses. 
For a starter we had the grilled calamari. Served in a house balsamic dressing with roasted pepper, it a had a slight smoky flavor. Nice. So often restaurants only serve deep fried calamari. 
My sweetheart had a salad with a side of shrimp. Comment here is that the shrimp was very nicely done. 
I had the spicy gamberi (shrimp) in marinara sauce. The pasta noodles looked house made but I am not sure of that. The marinara sauce was garlicky but I knew that going in. It was a great dish and would certainly order it again. 
The restaurant is smaller with murals of drawings of Italian scenes giving on a feel of Italy.

patsyannie,Unknown,2,Maybe it was a bad night,"We arrived about 15 minutes before closing after a long trip across the country.  We were told that it was near closing.  We offered to order ""to go.""  We were told ""no,"" please take a seat.  Bad mistake.  We quickly ordered a pasta and a veal piccata.  The pasta was like one from the freezer section.  The veal was about four ounces with about two cups of pasta.   No bread or salad came with the meal.  We ordered just ice teas.  When we asked about dessert, a tray of unappealing desserts were shown to us.  We were not the last ones in the restaurant, but we were in and out in about 30 minutes with a $53 bill including tip.

Maybe it was a bad night, maybe there was a kitchen problem, maybe they should have taken our offer of ""to go,"" maybe we should have gone to Burger King.   Sadly, we were thinking about bring about 10 people here for lunch during our stay.  Obviously, we went elsewhere.",5/16/2016,1,2,2,2

Came with wonderful homemade pasta.,4/20/2016,5,5,5,5
Tanya B,Unknown,3,It was ok,"We ate here because it was close to where we were headed and it had good ratings online.  I give it a 3.  The food was ""so so""; nothing spectacular.  I ordered lasagna while my husband had veal Milanese.  

On the lasagna, I think I was expecting more freshly made products especially for the price. The noodles were not tender enough for me and the sauce just didn't do anything to add to the lasagna.  In fact, I think it they should rethink the sauce.

My husband seemed to enjoy his meal but he also commented about the quality of his meal.  I noticed that he got two nice sized.  The Attila was very bright and fresh.

The portion sizes on both meals were generous.  We also had an appetizer plate with a variety of cheeses, olives, grapes, and a couple of varieties of meat. 

The service from our waiter was fine.  He was attentive and gave an appropriate amount of attention. In general. the rest of the wait staff was ok.

The decor borders on outdated but it was still in the acceptable range.  The linens and tableware were clean and fresh.

Joanne Y,Unknown,5,"Local gem, and it also has a wine bar!","I lived in this area for many years, and often drove past this restaurant without giving it a second thought.  This past weekend, my husband and I were looking for a nice wine bar to enjoy early spring weather.  When  I Googled, this restaurant popped up.  We decided to go.

Dress code is casual, yet when you drive up, they had a complimentary valet service. This is actualy a major plus, because the parking lot is small, and can get very tight.  We went into the restaurant, thinking it was the wine bar, and were informed that the wine bar was next door, but closed for a private event.  We were then offered a table in the restaurant.

When we were seated, we were handed menus that showed a nice selection of wines and beverages, as well as the food menu.   Wines were reasonably priced, and so were the food items we considered.

We eventually started with the Grilled Calamari.  For anyone who is used to Fried calamari, this is not that.  This is a grilled delight that is moist, and delicate, and tender, and really succulent to eat.  Pairs well with a crisp white wine, or can go well with an unassuming red, too.   

For entree, I ordered the liguine con vongole with red sauce, and requested it spicy.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was given that option, having never been able to specify the level of heat in the dish before.   Sure enough, when it arrived, it was wonderful, spicy to the point of a Fra Diavolo, which was a nice change from some blander versions I have tasted in the past.

My husband had the lasagne al forno, and it was incredible, too.  Fresh, flavorful, like homemade, only better.   Along with this there was fresh home made bread with olive oil, too.

Finally came the dessert. This was something that put this restaurant into a whole separate realm from many others.   I ordered a canoli, and my husband ordered the raspberry cheesecake.  We also ordered cappucino to accomplany dessert.

For my part, my canoli arrived, and the way the filling was in it, it was as if it had been made fresh and piped in right before it was served.  It was decadently sweet, yet not cloying...  My husband's raspberry cheese cake was just as delightful.  I would go as far as to say that my canoli might have been the best I ever remember eating.  The cappucino was so creamy it needed no sweetner and tasted rich and luscious.

The staff here is very polite, and amazingly attentive.  While the restaurant became very busy while we were there, we were not pushed to finish and leave, and they did not seem like they were frantic to turn over the table like some restaurants might have been.

Overall, the experience was a very positive one, and really, for the quality of the food, extremely reasonably priced.  I hope we can go back there soon, and would definitely recommend it to others.",3/1/2016,5,5,5,5

Rhoward2,Burke,4,Italian tapas,"This wine bar is the only Italian restaurant we know that offers cicchetti, the small plates similar to Spanish tapas.  We really enjoy the various plates such as the pizza cone, arancini and delicious salads and vegetable plates.  They have a daily happy hour special from 4 to 7 p.m. with a reduced price for some of the wines and $2.00 off on some of the cicchetti.  Their selection of wines is excellent.  The service is great and the atmosphere very inviting.",1/16/2016,4,4,4,4
Nancy W,Fairfax,3,Disappointed with the Change,"We have gone to Cicchetti's reverify gularly since it opened. Its happy hour was a tremendous draw including the availability of small plates and excellent wines at a discount.  We had not been for several months so checked the website to verify hours and prices.  When we arrived we learned that there had been a change of management so the happy hour selections had changed and were considerably more expensive. The quality is still good and the service was good but we were annoyed that the new management had not changed the website.  It was misleading, and quite frankly if we had seen the new pricing we probably would not have gone as we didn't think the new pricing was worth what we got.  Disappointing that a former gem has fallen by the wayside.",1/9/2016,2,4,4,4

They had great lunch specials, able to pick some sandwiches with a soda for 6.99 and then some others for 7.99 such as pizzas, etc. Good deal and ample amount. We also had a couple of glasses of chianti from an extensive wine list which was nice. We had the meatball parm sandwich and a margarita pizza. Both were just OK  but we've had these staples from other places that we prefer.

Amy H,Unknown,3,Overrated,"We were seated at our reservations time, but once seated we were never welcomed or greeted by a waiter. We were quickly served water and stale bread.  The olive oil/parmesan dipping sauce did not wow me.   After sitting for about 5 minutes, we were handed a wine menu. A reasonable amount of time later our orders were taken, but no mention of specials or anything. Usually waiters will ask if you want pasta or veggies or a salad. We were not asked any questions. I had wanted to order veggies rather than pasta, but forgot. Wish the waiter had offered a choice. 

We had the fish special (Wahoo). It was overcooked, but the mushrooms were good.  We also had Veal Picatta which was pretty good.  The side of pasta was the best part of the meal. We had a Baby Barolo and a Pinot Grigio, both good and generous pours. 

It was hard to hold a conversation due to the noise level and the restaurant was not at full capacity.  We were seated by another couple.....too close for comfort. 

I think Dolce Vita was perhaps a great Italian restaurant for this area years ago. I can think of plenty of places I'd rather go.",11/8/2015,3,3,3,3

Tom Pamperin,Washington DC,4,Great Food Reasonable Prices,"I met two friends for lunch today at Dolce Vita.  It was my first time at this restaurant although both my friends had been there before for lunch and dinner.  It is a pleasant but not overly fancy interior.  Service was prompt, attentive and informative.  I had Cannelloni al Forno, which was two cannolonies stuffed with veal and spinach in a tomato sauce.  It was delicious and just the right size for lunch.  One friend had Penne alla Modenese  which was penne in a cream sauce with mushrooms and Italian sausage.  I'm not much of a white sauce guy but I tried his and it was very good.  My other friend had Carne Stufata which was flank steak cooked with tomatoes and onions with rice.  I had a chance to taste that too and it was very very good.  The 3 meals with iced tea for each of us and tip came to $42 or $14 a piece.  For how good the food was, I think it was an unbelievable value.",10/1/2015,5,4,5,4

Maaa,Washington DC,4,"Good Food, but overall needs some attention","The place has always been one of the more popular spots in the area. Today's visit was good overall but the place needs some attention. The pasta is excellent, the pasta sauce is superb and I highly recommend anything with the creamy pesto sauce, and the pizza is excellent as well. However, the chicken (in the pasta dishes) was bland and chewy. The staff was very knowledgeable of the menu and are genuine and pleasant but werent always attentive. The place is due for a renovation especially the exterior if they plan on staying for the long run given all the new options in the area. The menu is also somewhat limiting and can use a few updates as well. Nonetheless if you're in for a hearty Italian meal in Fairfax, this is an excellent choice.",7/8/2015,4,4,4,4
Georgia B,Bradenton,5,A Touch of Italy,"The Hampton Inn is two doors away from Dolce Vita, and the staff recommended this restaurant.  It has a brick oven that is used for cooking numerous dishes.  I ordered fettuccine with scallops and crab meat with a light white sauce.  It was delicious.  I also had a Ceasar salad which was great too.  If you're in the area, it is definitely worth stopping!",7/7/2015,4,4,4,4
jfwilder,Unknown,4,Best Italian Food in DC Region,"The only reason I give this anything less than five stars is the atmosphere and the fact that even with reservations, we had to wait over a half hour to get seated, and then were seated in a small cove that was very loud for the size of the party.  There was another very large party that was very raucous and just would not leave even though they had finished long ago.  We were eventually moved to a larger table once they finally left....over an hour from our scheduled reservation.

As for the food, I've been to many a supposedly fine Italian restaurant, and nothing holds a candle to the quality of the food here.  Everything served was perfectly done, generously portioned and sumptuous.  Truly a place to go well out of your way to find.  It is small....so be ready for that.  You can bring a bottle of your own wine and there is a corking charge.  Otherwise there's a decent selection there already.

This is real, authentic food,. The pizzas and wood--fired, and the delicious smell wafts through the diningroom. The pastas are (thankfully!) al dente. The main entrees include standards (veal piccata, etc.) but the chef presents nightly specials. One of the best values is their lunch menu, where the portions are generous and include salad, bread and beverage. Occasionally there may be a wait; I've been coming here for years and the experience never disappoints. Full bar, including lovely, reasonable Italian wines.",6/30/2015,5,4,4,4

We called ahead and were told there would be room for us on their patio. Even though our number unexpectedly grew by a few, the manager was very helpful and worked to add tables to accommodate our group. The dogs all received bowls of water after we sat down. 

The portions are a reasonable size and very good. I would recommend asking your server about the portion size if you are unsure (some are small plate/appetizer) and other  entree size options are still not overly large. I had the Risotto Gamberi (with 4 shrimp), and it was excellent. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal, and was very pleased (choices ranged from pizza in a cone, risotto balls, salmon, risotto entrees and pasta).

The patio is right next to the parking lot, but they have tried to screen it to offer privacy and to reduce the exhaust fumes. The inside bar seemed to be a popular gathering place for ""locals"".",6/9/2015,4,5,4,5

The staff was very friendly and welcomed us even though we were early for our reservation. The place looked a little run down from the outside but was pretty nice on the inside, if a bit smaller than I had expected. We enjoyed a cheese plate as an appetizer and a variety of really awesome entrees too - everything was amazing!! We all got something different and we all loved it. They were also happy to make some substitutes for us too, including adding or taking out ingredients from the dishes. They were decently priced as well. We were checked on by many different people and everyone was very attentive to our needs and quick to help with anything we needed.

Yorkiemom19,Wyoming,4,Good Italian food in tiny location,"We had a celebration dinner after graduation and were very pleased with the food, the service and loved the cozy atmosphere. Fortunately, they put us in a booth because the dining room is pretty small. Our entrees came to the table hot and without exception, were very good. 

The lasagna was steamy hot from the oven, basil coated gnocchi was absolutely delicious as was the carbonara and ravioli. Good local place with delicious wine,  loads of cheesy goodness in the entrees and home baked bread with oil and Parmesan for dipping. I would have liked some seasoning for the bread dipping oil.  Although it tasted good, I don't think the cheese platter was worth 13 bucks. Be aware that parking is really tight.",6/7/2015,4,4,4,4
Janie R,Unknown,4,"Good Italian food, but cramped quarters","I like the food, but the tables are very close together because the place is small. It is very popular locally, but it is hard to have a conversation without feeling like the people at the next table were part of the conversation.
The salads are the standard salad you get with a meal. The bread is fresh and tasty. The pizzas are made to order and cooked in,their brick oven. I really like their manicotti because it comes to the table straight from the oven, full of gooey melted cheese. The pasta dishes that I have tried, like lasagna, have been very good.

I ordered an eggplant and shrimp appetizer and it was fantastic!  I am not a huge fan of eggplant however this dish has converted me..it was tender and flavorful.  Sliced into small bites with a shrimp on the top, it was my dinner!  The next night I came back and ate the steak salad, it also was an amazing meal!  I will definitely make this my mainstay when I am in town!  Good happy hour too with an outdoor patio, very nice!",5/25/2015,5,5,5,5

Anyway, we went in Saturday afternoon at 4:00, and what do you know....!?...happy hour started at 4:00!!  Apparently they have happy hour every day, which rules.  Many wines listed about 3:50 each, all drafts $3.50 (including microbrews), and some food is on HH too, including the Pizza Cone!  I think they were $3.00 and .25 cents for whatever toppings you add.  Let me tell you, this was delicious!  We all got em!  Different, and fun, and quite tasty.  Bartender(s) were very friendly.

mrs p,Front Royal,1,dolce vita in fairfax is not!,"Dolce Vita - Fairfax VA

Apparently this place ain't what it used to be....

A Saturday nite around 8:50 pm

The service was marginal at best....

The atmosphere was cacophonous to the point where sitting at a small
table with three others in the corner of an alcove it was impossible
to hear a normal conversational tone from the person next to you,
forget about the person across the table.... No problem hearing every
word that was practically shouted by those at other tables...

Italians are loud in the street but that isn't the norm in a
restaurant in Naples, Verona, Firenze, Milan, or any other city I've
visited in Italy... So much for ""real"" Italian ambiance.

I have never been hustled out of my table once seated in a real
Italian restaurant. Eating in Italy is practically ritual; respect for
time and space and the act of eating leisurely is the norm. Not here.
The bus staff was rude and abrupt, sullen even, at closing time (10:30
pm) despite having seated and served us. It was obvious that getting
us out of there at all costs was the primary objective.

The House wine, a Brunello Montalcino, was good. When there wasn't a
second bottle available the replacement was even better.

The clam appetizer was served unceremoniously without style or
attention to presentation... more thrown on the dish than anything
else. The clam breading was barely mediocre and finding clam in it was
a treasure hunt.

The cream sauce that accompanied the lobster special was unimaginative
and too thick. It detracted instead of complimented.

The Filletto was a good piece of meat that was ill served by the sauce
that drowned it.

The addition of grated cheese to the pastas was tantamount to having
it thrown on each portion so you got what was ""dumped"" whether you
wanted that much or not.

No one even offered fresh ground pepper.

We had deserts that were less than expected from their visual display.

I love good coffee. The espresso wasn't!

We had to ask to have our waters kept filled...

I find no good reason to return.",2/28/2015,1,1,1,1

jerseygirl347,Gainesville,4,Not hurting for business!,"I recently discovered that I liked Fettuccine Carbon at a place in Stafford called Zebibbo. It was the most luscious tasting white sauce pasta I have ever tasted. It's just not in a convenient location at 40 miles away. So I was on mission to find a closer place & had a hard time finding one with that dish on their menu. I thought of Dolce Vita, where I had been twice before 15-20 years ago, &   there was my dish- with the right description & I went. Said they took no reservations & there was a 30 minute wait. The place was packed, parking was bad- didn't notice the valet until we parked around the corner & walked up. Sure enough- 1/2 hr & no place to wait except at wine bar adjacent.  Got the last 2 bar seats there, luckily. They have a nice menu of the appetizer/tasting variety.  We got called over for our teeny crowded table next to 3 chatty, admittedly tipsy people sharing way to much info as tho we were part of their party. We didn't mind as we joked about them as we waited for a server. That took 10 min. Another 10 min & he appeared with bread & olive oil dip. Another 10 & he took our order. Apps & salad ordered; Caesar avocado stuffed w crab meat. Salad was very fresh &  was not loaded w/ garlic. I tasted the crab meat avocado & thought the crab meat was strong smelling & canned. The rockfish had by other party was described as excellent, but the accompanying pasta was garlic laden. My carbonara however did not have the flavor of cream & egg that the previous restaurant mentioned had, so I was disappointed.  It required a whole bunch of grated cheese, which helped salt wise, but the egg was still missing from the flavor I was looking for.",1/17/2015,4,4,4,4

Kyle S,Bugis,1,Horrible Management Experience,"We have been to Dolce Vita before, but the service this time really stood out. The food was its usual 3 star average Italian. After arriving for our 7:40 reservation, we waited a full 30 minutes standing in the cramped waiting area until finally deciding to order drinks, appetizers, and bread at the bar.

As soon as we sat down, our entrees were brought to us. They then brought us our check without apology. The most disappointing thing was the restaurant acted as if nothing had happened. We debated paying and leaving or informing the manager of the fact that the handling of our reservation was unacceptable. We decided to take the check to the manager to talk. The manager essentially challenged our account of what happened by checking when our orders were placed using the electronic ordering system, while the hostess stood nearby knowing full well exactly what happened. He thought he had an ""aha!"" moment by telling us that our orders were placed only 25 minutes after our reservation, not realizing that we placed the order while standing near the drafty bar, because we were hungry. Then after explaining this to him, he became slightly apologetic and asked us what we wanted him to do about it. After already challenging our integrity, he tried to negotiate a discount with us, so we then sat down and decided to pay whatever they gave us, and we are not likely to return in a long time.",12/11/2014,1,1,3,3

Several of our party didn't get their meals till after everyone else had finished and those were the Specials.  Other members of our party the food was slightly cold when they got their meal. This being said the staff gave us some free bottles of wine to apologise. They were friendly and apologetic, and we still had a pleasant experience.

exeter95,Dover,3,No idea why the great reviews,"Maybe there are literally no other Italian restaurants in this area, so Dolce Vita receives great reviews, but in all reality, it's a strip mall average Italian place that serves lunch specials for $11.99. The service was very good - authentic for sure. But the food was mediocre. I ordered a caesar salad with steak and the steak was tasteless and of low quality. Colleagues had pasta and typically southern italian dishes like veal and chicken parm, but I wasn't impressed at all. Bread was boring. The food was definitely reasonably priced (bordering on inexpensive), but I wouldn't come here again unless I was REALLY hungry.",11/25/2014,4,3,4,2

Happy2BeCR,Fairfax,5,A little piece of Italy in Fairfax,"The entrée selections are mouth watering.  Having dined in Italy, I thoroughly enjoy every entrée I've ever had at Dolce Vita.  To say I have a favorite would almost disrespect the many other incredible entrees I've had the pleasure of ordering.  Prices are great as well.

The family that owns & runs Dolce Vita are a class act.  Joe & Sharon truly bring Italy to Fairfax.  There love of each other/ Italy/ their food/ & their clients experience at their restaurant is unparalleled in any Italian restaurant in Northern Virginia.

Don't miss your opportunity to find your families newest favorite home town restaurant!  Take a minute to speak with the owners, as they will enjoy the moment as much as you do.

Thank you Dulce Vita for brining a little piece of Italy to my home town.

The restaurant was cozy and the staff attentive. I had a special lobster ravioli. The sauce was so good that I could have licked the bowl. What I loved was the portion size was just right. Not overwhelming. It left room for desert and being a chocoholic the chocolate mousse cake was extremely satisfying. The prices were reasonable.,9/28/2014,5,5,5,5

Austin A,Frankford,2,Disappointed,"I live close to this restaurant but until recently had never tried it. I finally did so based on the recommendation of a friend, and because it had generally good reviews in TripAdvisor. I doubt I will return.

There was nothing to distinguish this restaurant, from the bland tasting food to the common decor. I'd say that the service was good, except I got a confusing response when I called to make a reservation, and then saw one server (the only one wearing a green shirt the night I was there) drop a handful of spoons on the floor, and then pick them up and place them in the clean utensil bin without rewashing them. Need I state more.",9/27/2014,4,4,4,4
Alan B,Woodbridge,4,Real good,"I saw the reviews and figured it was worth sitting in VA traffic to get to Dolce Vita.  Was glad i took the risk.

I am here on business and plan to return again.",9/22/2014,4,4,4,4
sailingboat,Fairfax,5,Return trip does not disappoint,"This lively restaurant does not have the best location in town. Sitting between a Midas Tire store and a gas station, it has virtually no parking, but these ""problems"" disappear quickly. Complimentary valet parking is front and center and things just get better after that. Reservations highly recommended, especially on weekend nights. Inside, the first thing you'll notice is the large stone face on the wall into which pizzas and other dishes requiring a blast of major heat slide in and out on long wooden paddles. The décor is pretty and original and visually expands the space. There is one special booth (see photo) that you can try to reserve for special occasions like asking someone to marry you! Service is attentive and quick but not obtrusive. This is a great place for couples and friends, romance and special occasions. And if you need more room for your party, there is a party building next door. In recent years, Dolce Vita has also added a wine bar with lighter fare and special events. Everything here is made to order so get an appetizer and a drink that you will have time to enjoy. I had the figs and prosciutto (a special item that night) and my husband had the grilled calamari. Have to say, once you have had calamari grilled the right way, it's tough to go back to the fried with marinara sauce variety. The restaurant when filled can be noisy, swamping the background music, but it feels lively, friendly, sophisticated, and like being at home all at the same time.",9/14/2014,5,5,5,5

 The good reviews on Trip Advisor reflect the successful formula of good food and service.  It has an adequate ambience but food and service are the trump points!  

TIP::  for a quieter experience ask for the table in the corner in the very back. It is isolated from the rest of the restaurant to permit easier conversation. Also try going after 1:00 when the noon crowd starts to filter out.",8/6/2014,5,4,5,3

Bread was very average- they put on the menu a ""limit of two bread baskets per table"" but who would ever ask for more- it was a little stale and hard, not the great Italian bread you want at a small boutique restaurant.
Had bolognese and chicken with lemon-  there were no vegetables served with the meal, just pasta and a salad.
Ziti and pasta with salmon were good.
Lunch is well-priced- most expensive is $11.99 with most at $9.99.

There are quite a few items to choose from for both lunch and dinner.  My favorite at lunch is Penne alla Modenese, which consists of penne noodles with mushrooms & Italian sausage in a cream Sauce.  My mouth is watering as I write this, just thinking of this dish! This restaurant has been owner operated for nearly 20 years, by my calculations.  The attention to detail and quality service is very apparent.  The restaurant is a bit noisy, but not so much so to be a hinderance. There is good parking around this restaurant.",3/7/2014,4,5,4,4

We decided then to make it an annual anniversary event. We were telling friends how great our meal was and were warned: it's not like that when the owner isn't there. We didn't believe it. 

We have now been three more times, and can attest that is indeed true. We had two meh so-so dinners and one other spectacular owner prepared meal.

I recommend if you want an amazing meal, make sure the owner will be there, sit at the kitchen bar, and chat him up....otherwise it's a disappointment.",3/3/2014,3,3,5,5

Maybe the weather was to blame but we arrived to an empty restaurant and the hostess was friendly, but it was down hill from there.  Our waiter was very grumpy, and seemed annoyed by our presence.   I ordered my favorite dish, the veal piccata, and it was so bitter it tasted like they just squeezed lemon on tough veal.  I couldn't eat it or the bitter pasta.  My husband ordered the rockfish special and it initially tasted okay, but parts of it were mushy and undercooked.  It was obviously frozen fish so why have it as a special?",2/12/2014,2,2,2,4

CAThomas111,Fairfax,5,"Really, really, really good experience!","There were three of us to celebrate a birthday in a low key/conversation with friends atmosphere.  I've read some people had difficulty with acoustics but we didn't have that problem.  We went on a Thursday around 6pm and had no trouble getting a table.  We were there during happy hour which I have to say ended up being one of the best values I've ever had and had 6-7 glasses of wine on our tab and it was total $51.00- amazingly cheap for all we got.  It was a fantastic value.  There were several choices on wine for under $4.00 a glass on the happy hour menu and probably 7-8 ""cicchettis"" to eat all of which were priced under $5.00. The food comes in ""threes"" if you are trying to figure out how much to order- the fried rice balls and the meatball on bread appetizer each come with three pieces for example.  The calamari looked like a full order for the happy hour price of $3.99 (or there about) and the little crock of truffle mac n' cheese easily fed three of us due to how rich it was.  All of us agreed we were stuffed on the food so again, good portion sizes considering how cheaply they offer during happy hour.  We were there almost 2 hours and never felt ""rushed"" by the staff and had fantastic service-- even letting me sample 3 or 4 different reds on the happy hour menu before I chose one.

With a full bar and an extensive wine list, Dolce Vita makes for a most pleasant dining experience.  We've enjoyed several entrees and appetizers that are prepared in the finest Italian traditions.  The wait staff is pleasant but not overbearing.  The owner? or manager? is constantly roaming about the place assuring that all aspects of the operation are finely tuned.

Gillian D,Indialantic,3,Good Italian.,"Dolce Vita tries to have ambiance.  They have done a lot with the very limited space to make it intimate but the fact is -- there are lots and lots of tables squeezed in to a very small space.  It gets loud quickly when the place gets busy.

The food is good.  Definitely better than any chain restaurant.  Just not outstanding.  

The service can be hit or miss.

The wine is so so.  How hard can it be to serve a decent chianti at a reasonable price by the glass for an Italian restaurant?  There are those who will buy an expensive bottle, and those of us who prefer to just have one or two glasses without spending $10 per glass.

The parking can be tough -- the tight little lot out front fills up quickly so look to the lot behind the restaurant.",1/6/2014,3,4,3,3

Having travelled throughout Europe, we found the food authentic and well prepared - the menu is wide with many variations of pasta as well as meat dishes, fish and of course pizza. The atmosphere is boisterous and service can seem to lag a bit but the fish was cooked perfectly and the pasta fresh and hot. Maybe not a special restaurat evening but certainly a place to bring family or make a regular stop for our weekly night out. Nice house wines, great desserts and a pleasant experience with the resident wandering minstrel.

The food is small plate Italian, which is nice so you can get a bunch of different things for a reasonable price.  I imagine the owners would like you to linger and down a couple of bottles of the wine lining the walls as you get small plate after small plate, which sounds like a nice afternoon.  It is pretty tough to get here as it fills up quick and the parking is a nightmare.  There is valet service after 6 to help out.  

The last visit we took a turn through the menu, trying some different items.  First, the foccacia, which was more like slabs of toasted white bread with a nice dipping sauce.  There was nothing special about the bread.  The rice balls are good, but were a little cool, no cold.  They had a nice crunch and as a Happy Hour special, were a nice price.  The  Orecchiette baked with cheese and truffle oil was a nice adult mac and cheese.  If you are worried about truffle oil, don't be, it wasn't noticeable.  The Iceburg lettuce tossed with pancetta bits, corn, carrots, olives in a gorgonzola dressing was a nice salad, different, and unexpected.  We took a little break and then ordered the Mixed grilled skewers beef, chicken, and sausage, marinated in a balsamic vinaigrette over cous cous.  The cous cous was the large peral variety, and really buttery.  It held a lot of flavor, and the sausage was the best of the meat.  The chicken was a bit dry and beef was bland, but overall, not a bad dish.  

We were shown the dessert tray, which consists of entirely frozen examples.  Two of the desserts looked like and were more than likely straight from Costco (the half pineapple and half coconut), the other looked ok, but having them all come straight from the freezer seemed odd.  I went ahead and ordered the chocolate lava cake, which was small and more than likely from Costco as well.  When it arrived it was barely thawed.  We asked if it should have been hot and anothre waitress said yes and whisked it to the back.  Our regular waitress returned with a hot version (obviously microwaved) and explained some people like it cold.  It's lava cake.....who eats lava cake cold?  

Finally when we were leaving the waitress provided us with a stylus for a touch screen rather than a pen, which seemed weird as well.

Overall it was not a bad time and the food was fine.  I would consider going back with friends to allow everyone to order their own plates and to see other items on the menu.",6/27/2013,4,4,4,4

I was in Fairfax for 4 days of business meetings and stayed at the Hampton Inn in Fairfax which is about 1000 feet from Dolce Veloce.  I dined with them every night, yes 3 nights in a row, and was never disappointed.  Soup of the day was top notch. I'm still dreaming of the artichoke and pea soup.  I got the vegetarian pannini and it was just the right size and wonderful in flavor and freshness.  The by the glass wine list is extensive and the staff is friendly and welcoming.

annite57,Atlanta,2,Now just average Italian food,"Situated on route 50, this used to be a GREAT place for Italian food in the area. Last night, was not just a bad meal, it seems the place has fallen backwards from what used to be really special. The waitstaff does not know what is on the menu really; it's all pasta to them. The menus were dirty. The wine glass had food baked onto it. The bread was old. The olive oil was old. The wine list is tired and no one in the restaurant knew the wines.  
We got the canneloni and chicken parm. Looked like it was reheated. Sauce was probably sitting around for awhile. Felt like leftovers.  Dessert was tired... not really fresh.
So, in summary.  Cannot recommend.  I am fair when it comes to putting on a meal, but this place is going the wrong direction. Bathrooms average. Check for 3 with bottle of wine: $72.",3/5/2013,2,2,3,3

Cathy R,Beavercreek,3,Good wine list; food just okay,"Happy hour prices are good. Small plates to share is a great concept, but wasn't executed very well the night we were there. The food was mostly heavy and greasy; the pizza cones were inedible. The ""Pollo Ossobuco"" didn't resemble Ossobuco in the slightest; and while the balsamic sauce was tasty, the chicken was fatty and unappealing.  
I do highly recommend the excellent marinated roasted vegetable plate served with crostini.

GoodFood88,Washington DC,3,Simply average,"The folks at Dolce Vita are nice and the food is fine, but it certainly isn't the best experience in the area.  The wait staff barely knew enough english to get by, to the point we simply gave up trying to talk to them and resorted to pointing at the menu to place our orders.  Where we were seated was in the far back and we looked straight into the bathroom, which was not really appetizing.  

The food itself was under seasoned and uninspired.  It was on par if not below the Olive Garden.  

The parking issue is enough to make you not want to come, but if they now have valet parking, that should help a little bit.  There is not much they can do about the parking I am afraid.  Overall, it was fine, but just average.",1/2/2013,4,4,4,4
VetTraveler56,Marrakech,4,The Good Life,"Good food, at a very reasonable price.  Good quality/authentic Italian food with prompt and courteous service.  Good for a family or friends night out, not necessarily for the romantic - it gets a bit loud (in a good way).

Entrees were from around $18-25 with a nice selection of pasta, meat and fish.  If you want something simplier there is a very good pizza menu to choose from.  The only thing missing for my tastes was rissoto.",12/10/2012,4,4,4,3

The big plus is that they added valet parking which is fantastic since their parking area is small and convoluted. Same decor.

Menu is about the same especially our favorite grilled calamari  appetizer.  Food was as good as ever (although not as good as about 5 years ago when the entire staff appeared to be Italian) and service was very prompt and efficient.  I had the cioppino (mussels, clams, shrimp, salmon) w linguini and my wife had her favorite dish of garlic shrimp over buttered/oiled angel pasta.

MMNorth,Unknown,1,So so bad...,"This place is terrible. It's one of the worst Italian places I have been to in the area. I am shocked at their ranking... 

First, the waiters don't speak English and can't even answer simple questions about the menu. The ones who can, are rude and obnoxious. 

Then, our cokes were served from an open pitcher and were completely flat. The restaurant also charges for coke refills, which isn't customary in this area.

The food was terrible. I ordered a pizza and my husband ordered a calzone. We were both SHOCKED at how bad and cheap the ingredients were. Just to get a perspective, my husband normally doesn't even notice the quality of cheap commercial pizzas, so for him to comment on the food ingredients being cheap and bad was pretty unique - which prompted me to write my very first restaurant review.

Finally, the kitchen is atrociously dirty. While walking to the bathrooms, the door to the kitchen was open. The floor looked like it hasn't been cleaned in months, and the food prep areas were scary. 

The only good thing about this place is the price. But I guess you get what you paid for holds specially true here.",11/23/2012,3,1,1,2
mike i,London,3,Mediocre...Was Once Great,"maybe a victim of time or maybe just too busy a place...but dolce vita, in my mind, has slipped to mediocre food quality.  a great and varied menu, their brick oven pizzas are still great, but their entrees seem to be flavorless, pre-cooked (lacking freshness right off the stove, so to speak), and their wait staff have agrown inattentive.  i ordered the grilled calamari...drowned in balsamic, and cold, rubbery like it was cooked a while earlier.  then the chicken saltimbocca...dried out, bland, and the side of angel hair pasta was stuck in a clump, cold and with minimal sauce on it.  other times there with whatever entree, the side of pasta was not al dente or freshly cooked.  even the pizza sometimes comes out drowning in liquid in the center, or just doughy.  and the waiters come around once at the beginning, then seldom seem again.  a shame, because 10 years ago this was an intimate little place, never crowded.   in sum, overrated, pushed-out italian food.  my guest ordered the mahi special with olives and a red onion sauce...there were only 2 little pieces of olive in the dish, and no onion taste at all.  perhaps people are swayed by the name and broad menu...the image of ""veramente italiano"" but in reality, another italian-american restaurant.",11/22/2012,2,3,2,3

In the past we have had chicken or veal dishes which were also great. We enjou it here very much and the prices run from low to high. It just depends on what what you want or willing to spend.

Sunshine55va,Unknown,1,What Happened,"I have only raved this restaurant in the past and have recommended to my friends. 

Recently a coworker left and we and another friend planned to meet at Dolce Vita to have a great meal and reconnect - 

What a disappointment - service was friendly and didn't rush us - 3 ladies - you can imagine

The food was so not so good.  The bread was great but the dipping was totally blah - olive oil and parmesan cheese - ????  

Ordered Calamari and was not the traditional but big chucks of squid in some kind of a salad dressing.

Two of us ordered veal dishes and one ordered a salad dish.  My friends were so gracious that they did not say anything negative - they just did not say anything!

Veal was  tasteless and overcooked.  Pasta had burned garlic in sauce.  Kept trying to find something positive about my meal but could not.  Carrabba's veal is much better and much cheaper - I was so embarrassed that I paid the whole bill because it was my recommendation.

Atmosphere was great and casual and no complaints about the staff - the FOOD, though, was horrible.",5/29/2012,4,4,4,4

LovetoTravelnEatOut,Safety Harbor,5,Consistently Good Food and Service,"My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for 10 years.  The food is always good and the service is excellent.  They serve everything from pizza, pasta to higher price seafood.  Their Mussel starter is tremendous, as is the Vitello Della Casa (Veal Scaloppini with Portabella Mushrooms, Artichoke Hearts in a Sherry Wine Sauce).   My husband likes the Gamberi Marinara Or Fra’ Diavolo (Jumbo Shrimp Cooked in a Mild or Spicy Marinara).   They do not have a children’s menu, but do have pizza and will do ½ orders of the pasta if asked.  It is probably more of an adult restaurant, but if you have well behaved children I am sure they would enjoy it as my 10 year old daughter does.  On  most Friday and Saturday nights they have a musician which is fun.  On weekends they are always busy so best to get a reservation if you can get one (they will not take reservations for less than 4). They do have a small bar to wait at.  They are not inexpensive, but the pasta and pizza is reasonable.  The owner is always there and always remembers returning customers, of which they seem to have many,",2/16/2012,4,5,5,5

He returned five minutes later - asked what we would like to eat, departed as soon as we gave him our order without asking if we wanted anything to drink... we were ignored throughout our meal as another large party arrived and they shuffled people from one table to another to accommodate the large party. Never asked if I wanted more wine, if the meal was good, not offered pepper or parmesan with our entrees, no refill on bread, no clearing of the appetizer plates until I stacked them and handed them to the waiter... I've waited many a table and this was absolutely the worst, unattentive service I've ever received. What really got me was staff of 3-4 were fawining over two large parties of 8+ that they were guaranteed an 18% tip on due to their policy.... thye ignored a table of two with a $130 tab....we left him $10 with a note to be attentive should we return.",2/2/2012,3,4,1,2

pletzkeb,Unknown,4,Love this restaurant,"My husband, daughter and I recently had lunch at Dolce Vita.  I had been there a couple of times before, but it was the first time for my husband and daughter.  We started with their fresh bread and butter which was excellent.  We all had the Caesar salad which had a very nice anchovy flavor.  I had the Tortellini Pana  (veal stuffed tortellini in cream sauce) which was house made and so fresh and fluffy.  My husband had the Penne ala Modenese (mushrooms and sausage in cream sauce), which was excellent.  My daughter requested the chef make her Chicken Marsala which was not a problem at all.  It was excellent as well.  I love this place.",1/20/2012,4,4,4,4
Jason22030,Fairfax,5,Fun New Year's Eve Dinner at Dolce Veloce (Dolce Vita's Wine Bar),"While I can't comment on Dolce Vita, my wife and I had an excellent experience recently at Dolce Veloce, the wine bar side of the main restaurant. When our New Year's Eve dinner plans fell through at the last minute, we decided to give Dolce Vita/Dolce Veloce a try. The main restaurant was booked with reservations, but the hostess offered to seat us at the bar at Dolce Veloce. Even though the wait and kitchen staff were very busy with a private party, the bartender gave us excellent service, making sure he spaced out our order so that we weren't bombarded with multiple small plates at once! (He even put on a football game that we wanted to watch!) My wife's glass of wine and the five small plates we ordered were very reasonably priced.  The food was really good - my wife loved the foccacia with pesto, while I thought the zucchini roll-ups were quite tasty (and I don't really like zucchini!).  We will definitely be making a return trip, next time with some friends!",1/2/2012,4,4,5,5

Kalexander_12,Fairfax,1,Disappointing Food,"We arrived at opening at 11:30am on Saturday. No hurry and no rush. This place has been recommended to us by a number of friends. Its local and close by and we really, really wanted to love this place.  But we just can't understand why folks give this restaurant a good rating. We ordered chicken parm, pizza margherita, and spaghetti and meatballs. The bread tasted like it was left over from the night before. If the bread isn't good, usually the rest of meal isn't either and so it went.  The mixed salad (which would have been good) had rotten lettuce leaves in it and looked like it was from the spring mix container from Costco. I know as I buy that lettuce and have to clean out the rotten the leaves myself when I prepare it at home.  The least they could do is wash and remove the rotten lettuce parts.    The pizza was wood oven pizza, but it tasted like supermarket pizza.  The chicken parm was good, but we ordered meat sauce for accompanying side of pasta. The meat sauce tasted like an Italian sloppy joe not good and even my little guys who love spaghetti didn't like the meat sauce. The spaghetti and meatballs had very little sauce and by that time, we just had enough. Sorry but this just wasn't up to par. The service was very nice though.",11/25/2011,1,1,4,2

Food was above chain food italian but certainly not worthy of extensive praise.  Since the place is small, it became noisy and warm very quickly ... we were glad to pay the check and leave.

Ralph1952,Warrenton,5,Dependable excellence--and a bargain.,"There's a reason why Dolce Vita is always crowded--even on Monday nights: The food is solid ""paisano"" Italian, with occasional (and successful) up-market flourishes.  And given the quality of the food, the prices are a bargain.  My wife and I have eaten here at least every couple of months since we moved to Northern Virginia over fourteen years ago--and we have never been disappointed.  This restaurant may be located in a suburban wasteland along a major highway, but it absolutely is worth seeking out.  Favorite menu items: anything on the daily-specials list (Dolce Vita's specials really are special); the pizza a la Vodka; the Penne Arabbiata; the calamari appetizer, and the veal dishes. If ""Tuscan meatloaf"" is offered as a special, go for it.  Quality is high, but portions are (too) generous, so it pleases foodies looking for rustic Italian food, as well as those who want to shovel it in, but still want decent flavors.  And the staff members, who've been there ""forever,"" are attentive and helpful, even when busy--which they usually are.

Since then, we go here at least once, sometimes twice, monthly.  We've taken family and friends along, but mostly we go and dine at the bar.

It is a cozy, neighborhood place. As soon as I walked in, I really felt I was back in Italy at one of the local places we tried to find on our recent trip there. The service and, especially, the food were excellent.  As another reviewer said, it's a neighborhood place, so don't expect over-the-top service (but they leave you alone to enjoy your meal and I appreciate that); and don't be disappointed if the guitar player isn't too talented, but it all combined for a really fun, delicious, and special night for us.

Paco02011,Fairfax,1,Horrible Service,"My husband went on a Friday night.  It wasn't too busy.  Someone took our drink order at the bar and we were sat a few mins. later.  We waited awhile and other than the person bringing our bread no waiter came.  The person who took our drink order saw me looking around and asked if I had questions, I said I did and he answered them. I then asked if he was a our waiter, he replied ""sure I can be your waiter"" - not very reassuring.  Then awhile later the man who I think was supposed to be our waiter came over with no apology what-so-ever and quickly said ""are you ready to order""  when we told him someone took our appetizer order he started to walk away, we were afraid nobody else would come back so we called for him to come back and take our order.  Nobody checked  on us at any point.  I had to call someone over to ask questions and to get us to go containers.  I asked to see a dessert tray and waiting forever for that.  A third man took our coffee order and when the tray finally came the waiter rattled right through each dessert and was short when i asked a question.  
The ""waiter"" then at one point while we were eating dessert came over and hovered by my husband as he looked over our bill, then crumpled it up and walked away.  He then came to our table leaned over looked in my coffee and said ""oh, it's a cappuccino""  and walked away.  Then brought the check and hovered until it was ready.  
I was so annoyed, I wanted to say something to the manager/owner, but, I got the feeling he wouldn't care.  He was sitting talking to all the people he knew and barely glanced at our table as he walked by.  We don't know if they are always that bad, only take care of their regulars or thought we weren't worth the effort.  Whatever the case we would never recommend this restaurant.",5/1/2011,1,1,3,3

We had no dinner reservations and my father requested a specific booth.  They were able to accommodate us.   We ordered the house wine and it was really good.  Even showed me the bottle because I asked if it was boxed wine before we ordered.  

The menu has a lot of selections and my poor dad was used to coming at lunch and took some time to make up his mind.  

The staff was very patient and kind.  The water glasses were refilled, the bread was plentiful and melted in your mouth.  My father finally decided. 

Had a great meal - you must try the mussels.  

Long story short, my father went to the restroom and as he was coming out the staff noticed that he was having a problem.  They immediately let me know.  As I was getting him to the car, at least three of the staff came out to see if there was anything they could do.  Even hand delivered my credit card, a sweet young lady gave me some ice and a napkin, and again another staff member came out to check if we needed any assistance.

Yes, service can be disappointing at times and the building needs renovation/expansion, but you can't beat the food and price anywhere in DC city and metro area.   The grilled calamari is exceptional for those who appreciate real calamari.  We always get two plates with extra sauce.  The veal chops and meats are fantastic, but you have order them early since they have limited stock and they do not list it on the menu.  You also need to clearly state how you want your meat cooked, especially when requesting medium rare, since many of the waiter's native tongue is not English.  Guitar player is not the most talented singer but he always sits next to my daughter and sings her a song.  Keep in mind that it's a family run business and not a 4/5 star fine tuned operations, so don't hesitate be a little vocal/stern at times and you'll have a great meal.",1/23/2010,5,5,2,3
Sammiinthesun,Unknown,1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Service !!!,"My husband and I got to Dolce Vita at 7:15pm on a Friday night the hostess told us it will be a 45 minutes wait.  One hour and 45 minutes later we were still waiting. The reason is because the hostess seated the couples came in after us first.  I saw her talking to them and tell them they will be next when our name is before theirs.  So my husband and I let that go and wait for the next available table. Thirty minutes late, there is a young couples walk in and say hi to the hostess and then put their name at the bottom of the list…way way below our name.  Guess what she seated them after 10 minutes.  My husband and I spoke to the manager and he look at the hostess and did not thing and walked away without saying anything to us.  My husband and I walked out after that.

If you don’t know anyone who work at Dolce Vita, I suggested don’t even bother to show up to the restaurant because you will not be seated or served!  Horrible service!! A place we will NEVER return!!!",1/8/2010,1,1,1,1

VacationMama08,Washington DC,2,Disappointing,"We've heard such great things about Dolce Vita, so we were excited to go there for my husband's birthday dinner. Service was pleasant, but hesitant. The strolling guitar player that everyone mentions was there - cheesey, but sweet. It's all very family oriented, which is also sweet, but surely not a ""special evening out"" experience.
The food was, in a word, okay. We love Italian food, but truthfully, this is not good Italian food. I've had better flavor combinations and more subtle creations at Macaroni Grill, believe it or not. The penne alla vodka was tasty, but the pasta was overcooked and it really needed some fresh basil and really good parm to make it delicious. The grilled calamari was almost inedible - very chewy and bland. Polo Sorentino was okay - not thrilling. Spaghetti and meatballs was dull and spiceless. Even the bread and the house salad were dull.
Dinner for 5 with 2 appys and 1 bottle of house chianti was $165 before tip - kinda pricey for a highly mediocre meal. Next time we want good Italian, we'll head to Bonarati in Vienna. We won't go back to Dolce Vita again.",5/8/2009,1,1,2,2

cmania,Unknown,1,Will Never return!  Horrible Experience!!,"My experience at Dolce Vita was horrible and we will never return to this restaurant again.  As an Italian-American, I know the difference between a meat sauce, a wine sauce, and a creamy tomato sauce.  The fact that the staff tried to tell me that they served me a white wine sauce when it was a creamy tomato sauce is dispicable.  

My husband, brother-in-law and I went to tLa Dolce Vita to celebrate my husband's new job.  We had a great bottle of wine and some appetizers.   All was fine up to this point.  My husband ordered lobster ravioli with an ""Aurora"" Sauce, a creamy pink tomato sauce.  He loved it.  My brother-in-law ordered the canelloni with the aurora sauce.  Again, he loved it.  

 I ordered the chicken with eggplant, tomatoes and mozzarella in a white wine sauce.  When I got my chicken, I noticed that my dish had come with a creamy aurora sauce and not the white wine sauce that I ordered.  I informed the waiter that he brought me the wrong meal.  He took it back.  Shortly thereafter, I received a chicken dish with prosciutto and spinich in a white wine sauce.  It was not what I ordered but I ate it anyway.  When the waiter  came by, I told him that this was not the dish I ordered.  He got the menu and read it and he agreed that the first dish was correct except the dish has a cream sauce and not a white wine sauce.  He stated that the chef thought I would like the tomato cream sauce which is why he placed it on my chicken.  If I wanted the tomato cream sauce, I would have ordered the sauce but I was in the mood for a lighter sauce.  The chef should not have given me something I did not order.

As we left the restauant, I spoke to the owner and told him the story.  He tried to tell me that the sauce was pink because of the tomatoes in the dish.  I told him that I know the difference between a tomato cream sauce and a white wine sauce.  Tomatoes do not make a cream sauce!!  It was the same sauce on that my husband had on his raviolis.  His only attempt to make it right was to buy us a drink.  He should have removed the item from the bill and taken responsibility for the action of his chef and his waiter.  I have never been so disappointed, not only in the food, but in the customer service from the staff and owner.  

Big Disappointment!!!!!!!!",12/11/2008,4,4,4,4
Tom M,Unknown,4,Best Italian in Fairfax,"La Dolce Vita is the best home-cooked Italian food you'll find in Fairfax.  It occupies three small buildings on Rt. 50, with the main restaurant in the middle, the Italian pastry shop on the left and the small cantina (bar which also serves food) on the right.  Parking is limited, leaving many of us wishing the restaurant would buy out the auto shop next door for a much-needed expansion.

Inside, the interior has been improved with a small retrofit of the front door, but tables are close together and the accoustics can tend toward the loud side.  There is a small bar along the large wood-fired pizza oven in the front.  Beautiful painted murals decorate the walls, and frequently a strolling guitarist entertains guests.

But the food is why you should come.  The sauces are homemade and the meats and veals are outstanding.  The house salad is a fresh medley of seasonal leafs and a great balsamic vinegrette.  The bread is served hot.  Some excellent choices include the gnocci and the cavatelli. The wood-fired pizzas are unique and delicious.

Save room for dessert, especially the homemade cannolis and the tiramisu, which are among the best in the area.

The house wines are reasonable in price and come in half or full caraffes.",7/6/2008,4,4,4,4

However, the service was awful 
We were seated and waited 25 min for someone to take our order.  Overall, we had appx 3 different waiters. We ordered food with one waiter including a salad. Our food came and no salad and the person who gave us our food argued that there was not a salad ordered (There was a whole discussion about olive oil dressing - of course the salad was ordered).  The guy who took our order had come over and said sorry I forgot and walked away. Throughout our entire time eating - we were checked on once by the waiter. We asked different waiters there for another beer - on the third request we finally got one.  We ordered a dessert to take home - they had ran out of tiramisu and the people behind us took the last 3 slices.  There was a guitarist there who was quite annoying and loud - we were hoping he wouldnt come over and sing right in our ear and hover over our food as is what he did to the table beside us.

Even hand delivered my credit card, a sweet young lady gave me some ice and a napkin, and again another staff member came out to check if we needed any assistance.

My father is fine and he enjoyed his meal as did my friend and I.  

Please visit the Dolce Vita ""family"" and know that you will be taken care of in more ways than one!",5/2/2010,5,4,5,4
Onartim,Unknown,5,Magnifico!,"The dinner I had tonight was such a reprieve from reality!  From the grilled Calamari to the Past with Garlic and Shrimp cooked in a true Olive Oil, to the charming service, all on white linen, it was wonderful.! Go.  Relax.   And make an evening of it!",3/5/2010,5,5,5,5
WashDCLee,Herndon,4,Go for the food,"We've gone to Dolce Vita at least 6 times a year for more than 5 years.  Yes, service can be disappointing at times and the building needs renovation/expansion, but you can't beat the food and price anywhere in DC city and metro area.   The grilled calamari is exceptional for those who appreciate real calamari.  We always get two plates with extra sauce.  The veal chops and meats are fantastic, but you have order them early since they have limited stock and they do not list it on the menu.  You also need to clearly state how you want your meat cooked, especially when requesting medium rare, since many of the waiter's native tongue is not English.  Guitar player is not the most talented singer but he always sits next to my daughter and sings her a song.  Keep in mind that it's a family run business and not a 4/5 star fine tuned operations, so don't hesitate be a little vocal/stern at times and you'll have a great meal.",1/23/2010,5,5,2,3
Sammiinthesun,Unknown,1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Service !!!,"My husband and I got to Dolce Vita at 7:15pm on a Friday night the hostess told us it will be a 45 minutes wait.  One hour and 45 minutes later we were still waiting. The reason is because the hostess seated the couples came in after us first.  I saw her talking to them and tell them they will be next when our name is before theirs.  So my husband and I let that go and wait for the next available table. Thirty minutes late, there is a young couples walk in and say hi to the hostess and then put their name at the bottom of the list…way way below our name.  Guess what she seated them after 10 minutes.  My husband and I spoke to the manager and he look at the hostess and did not thing and walked away without saying anything to us.  My husband and I walked out after that.

If you don’t know anyone who work at Dolce Vita, I suggested don’t even bother to show up to the restaurant because you will not be seated or served!  Horrible service!! A place we will NEVER return!!!",1/8/2010,1,1,1,1

VacationMama08,Washington DC,2,Disappointing,"We've heard such great things about Dolce Vita, so we were excited to go there for my husband's birthday dinner. Service was pleasant, but hesitant. The strolling guitar player that everyone mentions was there - cheesey, but sweet. It's all very family oriented, which is also sweet, but surely not a ""special evening out"" experience.
The food was, in a word, okay. We love Italian food, but truthfully, this is not good Italian food. I've had better flavor combinations and more subtle creations at Macaroni Grill, believe it or not. The penne alla vodka was tasty, but the pasta was overcooked and it really needed some fresh basil and really good parm to make it delicious. The grilled calamari was almost inedible - very chewy and bland. Polo Sorentino was okay - not thrilling. Spaghetti and meatballs was dull and spiceless. Even the bread and the house salad were dull.
Dinner for 5 with 2 appys and 1 bottle of house chianti was $165 before tip - kinda pricey for a highly mediocre meal. Next time we want good Italian, we'll head to Bonarati in Vienna. We won't go back to Dolce Vita again.",5/8/2009,1,1,2,2
nova63,Unknown,5,Good food. Great ambience,We've been going to Dolce for many years; take our family from out of town. I love the trompe l'oeil on the walls. The food is very good; and we've never had bad service.,4/24/2009,4,5,4,5
cmania,Unknown,1,Will Never return!  Horrible Experience!!,"My experience at Dolce Vita was horrible and we will never return to this restaurant again.  As an Italian-American, I know the difference between a meat sauce, a wine sauce, and a creamy tomato sauce.  The fact that the staff tried to tell me that they served me a white wine sauce when it was a creamy tomato sauce is dispicable.  

My husband, brother-in-law and I went to tLa Dolce Vita to celebrate my husband's new job.  We had a great bottle of wine and some appetizers.   All was fine up to this point.  My husband ordered lobster ravioli with an ""Aurora"" Sauce, a creamy pink tomato sauce.  He loved it.  My brother-in-law ordered the canelloni with the aurora sauce.  Again, he loved it.  

 I ordered the chicken with eggplant, tomatoes and mozzarella in a white wine sauce.  When I got my chicken, I noticed that my dish had come with a creamy aurora sauce and not the white wine sauce that I ordered.  I informed the waiter that he brought me the wrong meal.  He took it back.  Shortly thereafter, I received a chicken dish with prosciutto and spinich in a white wine sauce.  It was not what I ordered but I ate it anyway.  When the waiter  came by, I told him that this was not the dish I ordered.  He got the menu and read it and he agreed that the first dish was correct except the dish has a cream sauce and not a white wine sauce.  He stated that the chef thought I would like the tomato cream sauce which is why he placed it on my chicken.  If I wanted the tomato cream sauce, I would have ordered the sauce but I was in the mood for a lighter sauce.  The chef should not have given me something I did not order.

As we left the restauant, I spoke to the owner and told him the story.  He tried to tell me that the sauce was pink because of the tomatoes in the dish.  I told him that I know the difference between a tomato cream sauce and a white wine sauce.  Tomatoes do not make a cream sauce!!  It was the same sauce on that my husband had on his raviolis.  His only attempt to make it right was to buy us a drink.  He should have removed the item from the bill and taken responsibility for the action of his chef and his waiter.  I have never been so disappointed, not only in the food, but in the customer service from the staff and owner.  

Big Disappointment!!!!!!!!",12/11/2008,4,4,4,4
Tom M,Unknown,4,Best Italian in Fairfax,"La Dolce Vita is the best home-cooked Italian food you'll find in Fairfax.  It occupies three small buildings on Rt. 50, with the main restaurant in the middle, the Italian pastry shop on the left and the small cantina (bar which also serves food) on the right.  Parking is limited, leaving many of us wishing the restaurant would buy out the auto shop next door for a much-needed expansion.

Inside, the interior has been improved with a small retrofit of the front door, but tables are close together and the accoustics can tend toward the loud side.  There is a small bar along the large wood-fired pizza oven in the front.  Beautiful painted murals decorate the walls, and frequently a strolling guitarist entertains guests.

But the food is why you should come.  The sauces are homemade and the meats and veals are outstanding.  The house salad is a fresh medley of seasonal leafs and a great balsamic vinegrette.  The bread is served hot.  Some excellent choices include the gnocci and the cavatelli. The wood-fired pizzas are unique and delicious.

Save room for dessert, especially the homemade cannolis and the tiramisu, which are among the best in the area.

The house wines are reasonable in price and come in half or full caraffes.",7/6/2008,4,4,4,4
jcrewcutie,Unknown,1,AWFUL Service,"The food is okay....
However, the service was awful 
We were seated and waited 25 min for someone to take our order.  Overall, we had appx 3 different waiters. We ordered food with one waiter including a salad. Our food came and no salad and the person who gave us our food argued that there was not a salad ordered (There was a whole discussion about olive oil dressing - of course the salad was ordered).  The guy who took our order had come over and said sorry I forgot and walked away. Throughout our entire time eating - we were checked on once by the waiter. We asked different waiters there for another beer - on the third request we finally got one.  We ordered a dessert to take home - they had ran out of tiramisu and the people behind us took the last 3 slices.  There was a guitarist there who was quite annoying and loud - we were hoping he wouldnt come over and sing right in our ear and hover over our food as is what he did to the table beside us. 
I was quite annoyed as I was looking forward to dinner. However, I would never return again and I will not recommend the restaurant to anyone else",6/28/2008,4,4,4,4

Service inattentive at best.    Retired military diner next to us
almost expired from thirst.     Make their pizza at home by putting
mozarella (admittedly a goodly amount) and Newman's Own on an English Muffin.

In short, run, don't walk in the opposite direction of this place.

csugal,Unknown,4,Good times.,"Considering I'm from Ohio, where we have ""Little Italy"" where everything and everyone is Italian, I tend to be a bit harsh on other restaurants who say they have authentic Italian food.  Dolce Vita was wonderful.  The food was superb and the staff are excellent.  I was expecting a typical generic Italian restaurant but was pleasantly surprised with our meals as well as the service.

tlandis,Unknown,5,Was great for us,"Being from out of town, we didn't have a reservation for a busy Saturday night, but the manager graciously  worked us in. (GREAT luck for us, a party of five did not show).  Comfortable, busy, bustling atmosphere.  Prices reasonable, house wine quite nice. We enjoyed our pizzas and two different kinds of pasta. Guitar player/singer throughout the meal was enjoyable.  Did special request for my mother (her birthday) which made the evening.  Would go there again without hesitation.",9/19/2006,4,4,4,4
Luv-to-travel-always,Washington DC,2,Not great,"This restaurant is really just average.  Most folks must not have much Italian food around this area to say that this place is great.  Several of us ordered different dishes of fish with pasta and it was just not great.  The garlic bits on the pasta were bitter because they were overcooked  and the fish tasted  like frozen fish would taste.  Someone ordered lobster ravioli and it tasted bland and tasteless.  The desserts were not much better.  I wouldn't go back frankly if I had a free night to venture out.  Oh, the last thing is the annoying older man playing the guitar and singing beatles music.",11/11/2005,4,4,4,4
Brenda F,McLean,5,My FAVORITE restaurant!,This is my very favorite restaurant. Everything is outstanding in my book. My favorite table is not in the large dining area with the handpainted murals on the walls. I like to sit at the tables in the front so I can watch the cooks in the open kitchen juggling pans and the woodburning pizza oven. ALL the food is excellent. The prices are reasonable. The service is perfect. The people are friendly. The only problem is on the weekends the wait for tables can be long; this is not a huge restaurant and it is popular. It does take reservations.,7/20/2004,4,4,4,4
